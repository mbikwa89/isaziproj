Start with an appropriate base image. For instance, if you need a JDK, consider basing your image on the official openjdk image, rather than starting with a generic ubuntu image and installing openjdk as part of the Dockerfile.
Use multistage builds
Use CI/CD for testing and deployment
Use volumes to store container data.
Always run an NTP client on the Docker host and within each container process and sync them all to the same NTP server.
